## HD-Wallet_Derive
HD-wallet_derive is a Python repository that allows for the ability to derive cryptocurrency accounts associated with a given mnemonic. It was copied into my repository for reference and a symlink was established with hd-wallet-derive.php to the wallet folder. This allows for a more the file to be called in other files without its path being referenced.
